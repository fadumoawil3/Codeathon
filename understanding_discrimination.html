                <h1> What is Discrimination?</h1>
                <p> Discrimination is the unfair or prejudicial treatment of people and groups based on characteristic such as race, gender, age, or sexual orientation, (American Psychological Association). Itâ€™s more than a social issue, it is an issue that has effected almost every part of victims lives. From being sexually discriminated against and recieving less opportunities, to the loss of human lives. Discrimination is a world-wide issue that we always need to be working towards reducing, in order to build a better and more sustainable future for not just us in the United States, but all people worldwide. In order to reduce discrimination and its consequences, we must first know what causes it and what impacts it exactly has.</p>
