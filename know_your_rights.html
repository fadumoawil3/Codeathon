            <h1> Why should you know your rights?</h1>
            <p> Knowing your rights in a given country or region is absolutely essential. It can protect you from abuse or exploitation, give you access to justice, allow you to p[participate in society to your fullest capabilities, ensure you are being treated fairly, empower you to make decisions that benefit you, and give you an overall peace of mind. Ultimately, being aware of what rights you possess allows you to have personal autonomy, fight back against inequality, and pursue your life to the fullest. </p>
            <p> Of the many rights you possess as a resident of the U.S., here are some of the most noteable below.</p>

            <h2 style="margin-left: 30px;"> Basic Fundamental Rights</h2>

            <div class = "rights_grid">
                <div>
                    <h3> 1. First Amendment Rights:</h3>
                    <p> The U.S. Constitution states that all citizens have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The U.S. Constitution also grants all citizens over the age of 18 to vote in state and federal elections. The practice of these rights cannot be violated by anyone, not even the government, so long as the individual in question hasnâ€™t committed a crime.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3> 2. 14th Amendment:</h3>
                    <p> The First Amendment grants citizens the right to freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, and freedom of petition. These ensure that citizens can voice their opinions, practice their faiths, and protest to the government.</p>

                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3> 3. Challenging Discriminatory Laws:</h3>
                    <p> The Fourteenth Amendment guarantees all citizens with equal rights and protection. It also grants everyone due process of law to all citizens if they are ever put on trial. This serves as a protection against unjust charges, sentencing, and punishments.</p>

                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3> 4. Ability to Seek Justice:</h3>
                    <p> According to the Constitution, citizens are allowed to advocate for awareness on topics such as equality, regardless of their color, gender, religion, etc. If a U.S. citizen feels as if they are being treated unjustly or a certain policy is discriminatory, they have the complete right to challenge that policy or law and advocate for justice.</p>
