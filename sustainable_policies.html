                <h1> What are Sustainable Policies? </h1>
                <p> The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals are a set of sustainable goals set by the UN in order to achieve “peace and prosperity for the people and the planet” by the year 2030. One of the main components of these goals is to decrease discrimination and promote equality. The UN is not the only organization to set goals like this however, other organizations like our government, the world’s governments, and other non-government organizations (NGOs) have sustainable policies in place in order to promote a better world. Generally, there are 10 main policies/policy topics you will notice among the various sustainable goals worldwide. </p>

                        <h2> 1. Inclusive Economic Growth:</h2>
                        <p> Ensuring economic opportunities are available to all people, including marginalized communities, allows people and communities to start supporting themselves and prevents discrimination by allowing all those who wish to participate in an economy to do so, (as in have the jobs, businesses, and careers they wish to work in).

                        <p> Having proper access to education not only empowers individuals and allows them to pursue their passions, but it also bolsters world economic growth as a whole for a given area. Education is also very important to new discoveries, technological advancements, and the betterment of the world overall.

                            There’s a saying, ‘health is wealth’. Adequate and affordable access to healthcare for all individuals regardless of socioeconomic status, ethnicity, nationality, or etc., makes it so that there’s less discrimination and more equality/fair treatment in healthcare. It also allows individuals to be self-sufficient and pursue their goals.

                        <p> 	Gender discrimination, otherwise known as sexism, is one of the most common forms of discrimination in the world today.
