                <h1> What are Sustainable Policies? </h1>
                <p> The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals are a set of sustainable goals set by the UN in order to achieve “peace and prosperity for the people and the planet” by the year 2030. One of the main components of these goals is to decrease discrimination and promote equality. The UN is not the only organization to set goals like this however, other organizations like our government, the world’s governments, and other non-government organizations (NGOs) have sustainable policies in place in order to promote a better world. Generally, there are 10 main policies/policy topics you will notice among the various sustainable goals worldwide. </p>

                        <p> Ensuring economic opportunities are available to all people, including marginalized communities, allows people and communities to start supporting themselves and prevents discrimination by allowing all those who wish to participate in an economy to do so, (as in have the jobs, businesses, and careers they wish to work in).
