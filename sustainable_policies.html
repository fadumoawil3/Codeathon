                <h1> What are Sustainable Policies? </h1>
                <p> The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals are a set of sustainable goals set by the UN in order to achieve “peace and prosperity for the people and the planet” by the year 2030. One of the main components of these goals is to decrease discrimination and promote equality. The UN is not the only organization to set goals like this however, other organizations like our government, the world’s governments, and other non-government organizations (NGOs) have sustainable policies in place in order to promote a better world. Generally, there are 10 main policies/policy topics you will notice among the various sustainable goals worldwide. </p>

                        <p>
                            Having access to housing is a basic human right and is essential in today’s world in order to have any sort of employment. However, many low-income individuals/communities do not have the resources to afford housing. So affordable housing and urban development (building new houses) helps empower these communities and allows them to have a place to call home.

                        <h2> 10. Redistribution of Wealth:</h2>
                        <p> Most of the wealth in the world is held by the top 5% of the world. Part of this is due to taxation systems that give breaks to big corporations who have millions, billions, or even trillions of dollars while not affording that same treatment middle class and low-income earners. Policies that would tax big companies more and use that money to contirbute to society in a meaningful way would help bring more opportunities to the people who need it.
